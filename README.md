# bn-wiki-scraper
This is a repository to form a bengali data set scraping the bengali wikipedia. This is primarily done for the [Mozzila Common Voice Bengali](https://voice.mozilla.org/bn) and will contain the bengali wikipedia for now. But it will contain sentences from other public domain sources later.
